Liver Cirrhosis is a complex liver disease characterized by extensive liver tissue scarring, often resulting from chronic conditions such as viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, 
or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. It is the impaired liver function caused by the formation of scar tissue known as fibrosis due to damage caused by liver disease.
Damage to the liver leads to repair of liver tissue and subsequent formation of scar tissue. Over time, scar tissue can replace normal functioning tissue, leading to the impaired liver function of cirrhosis.
